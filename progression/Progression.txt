Alright.  This will be fully fleshed out eventually, maybe if I get around to it whatever -S
Treat "//" as things that are NOT final.

Era of Fire - The Stone Age

Player has to accomplish the following goals in order to complete this section:
-Access to tools capable of mining tin/coppper
-Access to armor capable of fighting overworld creatures for resources
-Stable food supply
-Access to the following resources: Cobblestone, Furnace, Stone, Tin, Copper, Coal, Clay, Sugarcane

-Remove entire vanilla tool array, or basically every tool recipe in the whole game...
-Early Gameplay:  Searching for flint or other rocks on beaches or in rivers. Flint will be needed to allow players to access wood.

Material Progression:
Flint/Bone -> Wood -> Stone -> End of Era


Modlist for Era:
-Survivalist: By nature, this mod will be intrusive into the early game.  I shouldn't need to detail it, this entire mod should live and die in this era.
-Tinker's Construct: Access to early sections of TiC such as the tables and flint tools where applicable.  Perhaps buff bone tools to encourage early combat.
-Make changes to bows so that ranged weaponry is not commonplace
-Restrict the stencil table.  Just about remove the entire thing's recipe, only a few initial stencils should be available to the player.
-Keep early weaponry to Dungeon Tactics Knives.
-Storage: Drawers and Chests should be available.
-Metals: Player should be able to furnace and store tin and copper for later use in the early iron era.

End of Era:
Complete all outlines goals listed above. Move on to early progression in the Era of Iron




Era of Metallurgy - The Metal Age

Player has to accomplish the following goals in order to complete this section:
-Access to alloys needed for industrialization
-Access to at least 150RF/t or equivalent power
-Access to basic foundry for alloying, melting, and tools.
-Access to tools that are capable of mining redstone.
-Access to weaponry and armor that is capable of fighting the denizens of the nether.


-Early-Mid Gameplay: Player progresses through the first tier of foundry using normal progression outlined in the Progression Guide.  Foundry is not exactly well wiki-documented so I'll try to keep it up there.
-Player begins access to some of the earliest generators, more than likely some Railcraft hobbyist's or forestry engines.

Modlist for Era:
-Foundry: Earliest progression should involve use of a high amount of clay to get access to enough refractory clay for foundry's non-liquid metal machines.
-Move into early liquid metal casting (Bronze should be needed to make the Melting Crucible (Basic)
-Player should need most if not all of the Basic foundry things before being able to cast a bronze pickaxe and move into Iron
-Railcraft: Player should work on Coke Ovens (Also from IE), players should also have access to some form of cart-transport, perhaps a bronze minecart and the wooden rails.
-Immersive Engineering: Focus on getting creosote from coke
-Use Bronze to progress to Iron, 
-Power: Railcraft, IC2, Forestry, should give the player an early start to power. They should probably have access to just a tiny little electric furnace or something at this point.
-Use iron to do some stuff, maybe embers at this point.  I suppose progress to foundry standard levels.

End of Era:
Complete all outlined goals.  Player should be able to mine redstone in order to start the next era. 
Player must have been able to access the nether for the ability to make blast furnaces to use steel, though this next era begins more with the entry into electricity.  Though, that will still probably require steel in large the place of iron, but use copper and gold for wiretypes to create a realistic feel.


Era of Industry - The Electrical Age
 
Player has to accomplish the following goals in order to complete this section:
-Access to diamond and obsidian, as well as glowstone.
-Access to all common overworld resources.
-Has started to progress through all tech branches.
-Access to weaponry and armor capable of fighting the ender dragon.

-Midgame Gameplay: Player starts up machines, has access to the general basic functions of most tech mods within the pack.  The player also has access to the midgame of magic mods, most of which should have been available to start in the previous age.
-Player will need a stable power supply for this era in both EU and RF/T/FE (Collectively GE, as I will refer to it)

Modlist for Era:
-Foundry: Tier 3 foundry alloying so that the player has access be able to melt ALL metals into liquid form.  (MT Guys -- Do not ever set the melting point of foundry liquids to 4000, it cannot hit that high)
-Modularity: Intro to modularity, most likely access to the general suite of machines, but nothing fancy like plates or machine updgrades
-Industrialcraft 2: Access to ALL of IC2 pre-advanced machine frame.
-Immersive Engineering: Access to general IE stuff just none of the larger multiblocks (Arc Furnace, Excavator)
-Railcraft: ALL of railcraft should be available.
-Allow some gendustry and all of base forestry
-RFTools: No access to RFTDims yet, but access to some of the mod such as its storage systems.
-EnderIO: Pre-Soularium, and Pre-Vibrant.

End of Era:
Complete all goals. Player should have a stable power supply capable of running a quarry and the materials necessary to create an large-scale IE Multiblock or RFT Builder Quarry by the end of this era, which signals the start of the next.


Era of Automation - The Modern Age

Player has to  accomplish the following goals:
-Access to AE2 Presses
-Access to Cyberware RoboSurgeon
-Access to Flux Networks
-Access to some use of Deep Resonance or Extreme Reactors

-Late-Mid Gameplay: Player is now creating large automatic systems to do tasks previously requiring manual labor.  Automation on large scales, through processes such as IE Multiblocks, RFT Autocrafting (No AE2 Autocrafting yet), and resource quarries.

Modlist for Era:
-Immersive Engineering: ALL components finally available
-Modularity: Level 1 machine updgrades available, Level 2 by the end of era
-IC2: Access to Advanced Machine Block and its subsequent pieces, but not every last bit of it. No Quantum or UUM yet.
-RFTools: Still nothing more than the last era except for access to the builder as a quarry.
-EnderIO: Post-Soularium, Pre-Vibrant

End of Era:
Goals. Player should have stable resources enough to be able to create futuristic looking bases and complex and powerful systems using Energistics.



Era of Creation - The Information Age





Player has to accomplish the following goals

//- RFTools & Machines 
//- Modularity 
//- Applied Energistics 2 (?)
//- ExtremeReactors ( Reactors 8x-12x less fuel efficient possible requiring of IC2 nuclear scrap )

Space Age (Planetary) - I think we need planetary first.
 
//- Planetary
