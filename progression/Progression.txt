Alright.  This will be fully fleshed out eventually, maybe if I get around to it whatever -S
Treat "//" as things that are NOT final.

Era of Fire - The Stone Age

Player has to accomplish the following goals in order to complete this section:
-Access to tools capable of mining redstone
-Access to armor capable of fighting overworld creatures for resources
-Stable food supply
-Access to the following resources: Cobblestone, Furnace, Stone, Bronze, Tin, Copper, Coal, Clay, Sugarcane
-Remove entire vanilla tool array, or basically every tool recipe in the whole game...

Modlist for Era:
-Survivalist: By nature, this mod will be intrusive into the early game.  I shouldn't need to detail it, this entire mod should live and die in this era.
-Tinker's Construct: Access to early sections of TiC such as the tables and flint tools where applicable.  Perhaps buff bone tools to encourage early combat.
-Make changes to bows so that ranged weaponry is not commonplace
-Restrict the stencil table.  Just about remove the entire thing's recipe, only a few initial stencils should be available to the player.
-Keep early weaponry to Dungeon Tactics Knives.
